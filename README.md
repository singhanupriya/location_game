# location_game
A game where creature moves in a 2D plane and with every movement, his location gets updated
Point.h--- a header file which keeps track of the location i.e. x and y coordinates of the creature.
Creature.h--- a header file which has the creature's name and its location taken from the point.h file.
Main.cpp--- which combines both the header files
